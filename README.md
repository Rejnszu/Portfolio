# Portfolio

Portfolio site
https://rejnszu.pl/

Looking now at this site, after few monts, I see so many flaws that it hurts. At the time I was creating it I didn't really care about clean code or naming conventions(well actually I did but my knowledge at that point of time didn't let me do it the best way), I just had some goals to achieve and I did it, everything was working and that was great. First of all CSS naming is really messed up, there is almost no BEM introduced, only in some later stages of site you can find it. JS ,ehh lets not talk about it> I was so fascinated with new features and things Javascript has to offer that I wanted to try it all and didn't care if it was looking good in terms of code or not, at the end of the day it was me who  had to know what the hell is going on there and I did. I will try to refactor it but I am not sure if its worth time, making next portfolio site will be faster I think : P.
